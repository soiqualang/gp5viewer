alphaTab can load music notation from various sources like Guitar Pro 3-5, Guitar Pro 6, AlphaTex and MusicXML (experimental) and render them into beautiful music sheets right within your browser (or application). Using [alphaSynth](http://github.com/CoderLine/alphaSynth) the music sheets can also be played in your browser without the need of any plugins (HTML5 Web Audio if available, fallback to flash) .
