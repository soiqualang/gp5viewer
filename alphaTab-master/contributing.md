# Guidelines for Contributing to alphaTab. 

I am happy that you are interested in alphaTab and want to contribute by entering bugs, feature requests, asking questions or even contribute code. Please play with the rules. It's not only about what you say, but also how you say it. Playing nice increases the chance of getting features/bugfixes faster :wink: Remember that everything you get here is for free and in the end it's about giving and taking. 

## Before entering an issue

* Check if your topic has already been covered. Use the search function and respond to an existing issue instead of opening a new one if you find a match. 
* Use the issue template! The template is there on purpose and not just there to be deleted and state a 1 line question. This helps to keep the requests structured. The issue template works for all kind of requests (see below)

## Entering Bugs
Fill out all sections properly so I can understand what's not working and how it expect ot be working. In JsFiddles are very welcome but also screenshots and sample files (if available) help me to reproduce the problem and narrow down the issue. 

## Entering Feature Requests
You've got an idea for a new feature? There is something missing which should be supported by alphaTab? I'm happy to hear about it. Propose in the *Expected Results* what the feature should do and how it should behave. In the *Observed Results* you can describe the current state of alphaTab. If the new feature is related to something that exists, you can note it there as a reference. For most cases a 1 liner that a certain functionality is not yet available might be sufficient. 

## Entering General Questions

Also for general questions you typically have an environment that you are targeting. Please provide it. The question can be stated in the *Expected Results* (you *expect* to have an answer to your open question, don't you? :wink: ). For most cases the *observed results* section can be removed, but if you can refer to any existing content please do so here. 

The *steps to reproduce* and *possible solution* are mostly not required for most cases. If you have assumptions about your question, you can note them here. 

## Contributing Code

Code changes can be offered by opening pull requests. Fork alphaTab, add your changes and file a pull request. 
When adding changes to alphaTab ensure they are compiling and working on all platforms.
